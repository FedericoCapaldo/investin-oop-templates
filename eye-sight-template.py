# DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Medium
# SUMMARY: Create a Customer class and EyesightTest class, so that each customer
#  can keep track of their eyesight appointment history.
# IMPORTANT: Follow the correct order of the instructions to create you program successfully!


# 1.0 Create a Customer class
# 1.1 the class should be initialized with the following properties (only name is received during object creation)
#   name
#   eye_sight_visits (just an empty list)
# 1.2 create a function called say_hello(self) in the Customer class that prints "Hi, my name is" + the name of customer
# 6. create a function in the Customer class called 'save_eyesight_test(self, new_test)' that stores a new test in the eye_sight_visits property
# 8. create a function that returns all the eyesight tests (i.e. eye_sight_visits)


# 3.0 Create class EyesightTest
# 3.1 the class should be initialized with the following properties (all received at object creation)
#   short_sightedness (it is measured from 0 - perfert eye - until -10.00)
#   astigmatism (it is measured from 0 - perfect eye - until 20.00)
#   test_date (e.g. '15/04/2020')
# 3.2 create a function in the EyesightTest class that returns a summary of the test with all it's info


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("hello, world")

    # 2.0 create a customer object jenny
    #  initialize this object with name 'jenny'

    # 2.1 make jenny say hello (this should print out on the screen)

    # 4. create and EyeTest object test1
    # initialize this object with the desired values (hopefully our customer has good eyesight!),
    # the date of the test should be sometime in 2020

    # 5. create and EyeTest object test2
    # initialize this object with the desired values (perhaps our customer sight worsened a bit!),
    # the date of the test should be sometime in 2022

    # 7. add both tests to the Customer object jenny

    # 9. print a summary of each test for the customer jenny
