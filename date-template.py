# DIFFICULTY LEVEL: Easy (compared to the other exerices, but it's still challenging!)
# SUMMARY: Create a DateStamp class which takes day, month, and year as properties.
#  Then create an object with a date of your choice and print it back with a fucntion.


# 1.0 create DateStamp class
# 1.1 the class should should be initialized with the following properties (all received at object creation)
#   day
#   month
#   year
# 1.2 create a function called get_date(self) in the DateStamp class that return the date in the format dd/mm/yyyy
#   hint: str(number) converts a number to string, you may need this to convert the day, month, year from numbers to string in order to print correctly.
# 4. create a function called set_date(self, new_day, new_month, new_year) in the DateStamp class to set a new day, month, year in its respective properties


if __name__ == "__main__":
  print("hello, world!")

  # 2. create a DateStamp object called dateOne
  #  (initialize the object with day, month, year of your choice)

  # 3. print the date of dateOne

  # 5. give dateOne a new day, month, year

  # 6. print again the date of dateOne
